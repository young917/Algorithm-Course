2018.12.04 ~ 2018.12.11

GOAL
---

Design and implement a Huffman Coding-based file compression utility program.

Focus on Correctness of Implementation and Performance of Program(Compression ratio).

Don't need to focus on time complexity.


EXECUTION
---

*Compress*

`mp3_20171697 -c input.txt`

Then, output file "input.txt.zz" is created.



*Decompress*

`mp3_20171697 -d input.txt.zz`

Then, output file "input.txt.zz.yy" is created.

* **original characters** :

* **length of encoded key about Huffman Tree composition** :

* **remainder after the length is divided by 8** :

* **encoded key about Huffman Tree composition** :

* **length of encoded key about original text** :

* **remainder after the length is divided by 8** :
